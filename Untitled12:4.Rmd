This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(readr)
libraryData <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpemartin/github-data/master/library100_102.csv")
```

```{r}
libraryData %>%
  mutate_at(
    var(學院，書籍館藏地，書籍類別),
    funs(
      as.factor(.)
    )
  ) ->libraryData
```

```{r}
libraryData %>%
  mutate(
    借閱時間=ymd_hms(借閱時間,tz="Asia/Taipei")
  ) -> libraryData
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
